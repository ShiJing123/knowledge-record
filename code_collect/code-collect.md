## Image Feature
[VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/index.html) 是一个开源的图像特征提取工具包。
> The VLFeat open source library implements popular computer vision algorithms specializing in image understanding and local features extraction and matching. Algorithms include Fisher Vector, VLAD, SIFT, MSER, k-means, hierarchical k-means, agglomerative information bottleneck, SLIC superpixels, quick shift superpixels, large scale SVM training, and many others. It is written in C for efficiency and compatibility, with interfaces in MATLAB for ease of use, and detailed documentation throughout. It supports Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The latest version of VLFeat is 0.9.20.

## Clustering Python Tookit
[scikit-feature](http://featureselection.asu.edu/index.php) 是一个包含了大量的聚类算法python工具包。
> scikit-feature is an open-source feature selection repository in Python developed at Arizona State University. It is built upon one widely used machine learning package scikit-learn and two scientific computing packages Numpy and Scipy. scikit-feature contains around 40 popular feature selection algorithms, including traditional feature selection algorithms and some structural and streaming feature selection algorithms. It serves as a platform for facilitating feature selection application, research and comparative study. It is designed to share widely used feature selection algorithms developed in the feature selection research, and offer convenience for researchers and practitioners to perform empirical evaluation in developing new feature selection algorithms.
