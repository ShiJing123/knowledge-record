## tasks
__Sparse representation based classification__ (SRC) seeks to represent the testing data with a sparse linear combination of training data. SRC assumes that, if sufficient training samples are available from each class, it is possible to represent each testing sample by a linear combination of a sparse subset of the training samples. The class label of the testing sample is assigned as the class with the minimum representation residual over all classes.
